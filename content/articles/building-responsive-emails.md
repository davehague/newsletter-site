# Building Responsive Email Templates with MJML

Creating responsive email templates can be challenging due to the inconsistent CSS support across email clients. MJML (Mailjet Markup Language) solves this problem by providing a semantic markup language that compiles to responsive HTML.

## Why MJML?

Traditional HTML/CSS approaches often break in various email clients. MJML addresses these issues:

- **Cross-client compatibility**: Works across all major email clients
- **Responsive by default**: Mobile-first design approach
- **Semantic markup**: Easy-to-understand component structure
- **Maintainable code**: Clean, readable markup

## Getting Started

Install MJML in your project:

```bash
npm install mjml
```

## Basic MJML Structure

Every MJML email follows this structure:

```xml
<mjml>
  <mj-head>
    <mj-title>Email Title</mj-title>
    <mj-preview>Preview text...</mj-preview>
    <mj-attributes>
      <mj-all font-family="Arial, sans-serif" />
    </mj-attributes>
  </mj-head>
  <mj-body>
    <mj-section>
      <mj-column>
        <mj-text>Your content here</mj-text>
      </mj-column>
    </mj-section>
  </mj-body>
</mjml>
```

## Key Components

### Layout Components
- `<mj-section>`: Rows in your email
- `<mj-column>`: Columns within sections
- `<mj-group>`: Group columns together

### Content Components
- `<mj-text>`: Text content
- `<mj-button>`: Call-to-action buttons
- `<mj-image>`: Images
- `<mj-divider>`: Horizontal dividers

### Advanced Components
- `<mj-hero>`: Hero sections
- `<mj-carousel>`: Image carousels
- `<mj-navbar>`: Navigation bars

## Best Practices

### 1. Keep It Simple
Email clients have limited CSS support, so stick to basic layouts and styling.

### 2. Test Across Clients
Use tools like Litmus or Email on Acid to test your templates across different email clients.

### 3. Optimize for Mobile
Most emails are opened on mobile devices, so prioritize mobile experience.

### 4. Use Semantic Structure
MJML's component system makes your templates more maintainable and understandable.

## Integration with Node.js

Compile MJML templates in your Node.js application:

```javascript
const mjml = require('mjml')

const template = `
<mjml>
  <mj-body>
    <mj-section>
      <mj-column>
        <mj-text>Hello, world!</mj-text>
      </mj-column>
    </mj-section>
  </mj-body>
</mjml>
`

const { html } = mjml(template)
console.log(html) // Responsive HTML output
```
